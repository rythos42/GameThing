Necessary UX:
	- show which side a player is on
	- force person to do something with a character each turn
	- hide new turn button if not your turn
	- hide cards after pressing new turn button
	- show when your turn is done because you can't do anything else
		- show when characters out of moves
		- show when characters can't play cards anymore
	- note when character is "locked in" and which character can be played, even after you de-select
	- allow players to look at their shit when it's their turn
	- after characters die can end in a place where one side has nothing left to move but the other does
	- stuff at range 0 played on self without needing to tap again
	- show which player is selected and their stats
	- show which card is selected
	- make squares on map visible
	- selected character to show available movement range
	- selected card shows available target range
	- turn bottom characters around
	- show remaining cards in deck
	- TauntCondition needs a message for success/fail
	- starting game from GPG throws because game data is null
	- ability to go back to main screen from game

Maybe necessary game dev
	- random starting positions within a specified range
	- terrain
		- probably need to re-do drawing order during this
	- Possible that some support cards need longer ranges
	- Possible that decks need more starter attack cards
	- Possibly need a defense card

Nice to have:
	- don't allow friendly fire
	- fix card sizing on tablet
		- rejig HandOfCards spacing to shrink the cards if they don't fit!
	- hide start screen buttons if loading shit (or give a loading splash screen and THEN go to game)
	- maybe don't automatically go to a match if we have one -- might be the user has multiple
	- show logout button to GPG
	- clear SignOut obsolete warning
	- hide "Join as Spaghetti" button
	- make side assignment random
	- shouldn't need to de-select a character to select a new one
	- make characters move on game loop
	- fix map background
	- better hand/card UI 
	- zoom is too quick, needs to be slower
	- pan is to SLOW, or needs a bounce to it
	- fix autorotate landscape
	- Awkward Distraction is awkwardly written

Tech
	- decent chance that GameHelper/BaseGameActivity aren't doing the right things anymore -- seems to be a mash-up of older sign-in code and newer
	- lots of events being passed through MainGame to MainActivity -- wonder if there is a better architecture that still keeps the Android pieces separate

Game Dev
	- evaluate whether single character or whole side is a better turn
	- make character facing directions (like for Slipped Backstab)
		- there's no "behind" for this to do anything with
		- make Slipped Backstab only if behind the character
	- have characters face the direction they last moved towards
	- make movement depend on agilty score
		- make runcondition an agility buff?
