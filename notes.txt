Maybe necessary game design
	- terrain
		- add trees
			- probably need to re-do drawing order during this
		- check that characters look right in different positions on the map
	- Possible that some support cards need longer ranges
	- Possible that decks need more starter attack cards
	- Possibly need a defense card

Nice to have:
	- TauntCondition needs a message for success/fail
	- stuff at range 0 played on self without needing to tap again
	- don't allow friendly fire
	- fix card sizing on tablet
		- rejig HandOfCards spacing to shrink the cards if they don't fit!
	- hide start screen buttons if loading shit (or give a loading splash screen and THEN go to game)
	- maybe don't automatically go to a match if we have one -- might be the user has multiple
	- show logout button to GPG
	- clear SignOut obsolete warning
	- hide "Join as Spaghetti" button
	- make side assignment random
	- shouldn't need to de-select a character to select a new one
	- make characters move on game loop
	- fix map background
	- better hand/card UI 
	- zoom is too quick, needs to be slower
	- pan is to SLOW, or needs a bounce to it
	- fix autorotate landscape
	- Awkward Distraction is awkwardly written
	- save the game after each time a character goes, rather than after each player turn (one side with extra characters, game isn't saved between character turns)
	- hide "No more moves from opponent" status panel when ending turn
	- center text on buttons again
	- character names
	- allow players to look at their shit when it's not their turn

Tech
	- decent chance that GameHelper/BaseGameActivity aren't doing the right things anymore -- seems to be a mash-up of older sign-in code and newer
	- lots of events being passed through MainGame to MainActivity -- wonder if there is a better architecture that still keeps the Android pieces separate
	- not calling UnloadContent anywhere
	- stop passing ContentManager around, I'm more likely to load most things at startup at this point anyway
	- warnings in Monogame Pipeline
	- how to do polygon objects in maps
	- Nexus 7 shows black box instead of highlighted character

Game Design
	- evaluate whether single character or whole side is a better turn
	- make character facing directions (like for Slipped Backstab)
		- there's no "behind" for this to do anything with
		- make Slipped Backstab only if behind the character
		- have characters face the direction they last moved towards
	- make movement depend on agilty score
		- make runcondition an agility buff?
