- consider giving Shane my old phone...I could really use his "fuck the game" mindset.
- game needs an Armour stat
- show categories of cards

Building a basic class hierarchy
	- Need more categories for some of these "higher level" things
	- Need more pizazz for cards >.<
	- some of these cards could be entire expansion blocks worth of ideas, separate them out.

		Block next attack
		Teleport but only play 1 card
		Draw additional card
		Draw a card and give one additional play
		Discard hand and draw new
		Give character armour
		Deal damage and gain health
		deal damage and gain armour
		Deal damage within range
		Increase str/agil/int within range
		taunt within range
		summon creatures
			explode for damage
			auto attack
			attack immediately
			if killed, split into smaller creatures
			power equal to hand size
			swarm
		play card, draw another card and play another
		when you play 2 cards from the same category in a row, gain buff to an affinity stat (like reckless->strength)
		play additional card this turn and one fewer next turn
		play additional card this turn, choose a character to play one fewer on it's next turn
		When you take damage gain % of it back
		replay all cards you played this game
		heal all health to all players (ALL)
		deal damage to all players (ALL)
		bring back dead player
		draw card and copy it
		draw card from specific category
		regain all playable cards this turn
		heal within range
		gain armour within range
		remove 1 playable card from player (not 2)
		remove movement from player
		give player big + to stats, then remove with penalty
		play cards randomly
		deal damage randomly within range
		player discards a card (doesn't redraw until end of turn)
		draw additional card for X turns
		choose healing or damage
		for X turns can only take 1 damage at a time
		draw 2 cards, play immediately if it belongs to a certain category
		discover a card
		set health to % of total
		remove condition
		remove all conditions
		paired cards: big power if played in a row
		draw card from discard pile
		no duplicates in deck: get something
		add random cards to hand
		take 2 turns (characters) in a row
		prevent character from going until very end of turn
		force character to go next
		when one character takes damage, gain health
		when one character takes damage, deal damage to (melee?) attacker
		repeat all cards from certain category played already
		can't be targeted by cards of certain category
		attack and buff players within range
		restore health and draw cards
		players within range discard cards
		next card played twice
		when attacked, deal damage within range
		deal damage to 2 characters in melee range
		deal damage to all characters in melee range
		if holding a card of a certain category, gain something
		gain health for X turns
		gain armour for X turns
		play random card from deck
		gain strength/agil/int for X turns
		if played card of category last turn, gain something
		X turns, deal damage to all characters in range, can't attack or move
		X turns, heal to all characters in range, can't attack or move
		if killed, res at low health
		deal small damage to multiple targets
		take card from character
		copy opponents hand
		whenever yoi play a card, gain a particularly powerful card
		end of turn deal smaller damage to all characters in range for X turns

		whenever character kills a player, immediately regain all movement and playable cards






Manage Team
	- implement character levels
	- edit character decks
	- delete team
	- change character class
	- view character category levels
- need many more cards


Nice to have:
	- allow characters to stand on slopes
		- draw grid on slopes
	- TauntCondition needs a message for success/fail
	- stuff at range 0 played on self without needing to tap again
	- don't allow friendly fire
	- fix card sizing on tablet
		- rejig HandOfCards spacing to shrink the cards if they don't fit!
	- hide start screen buttons if loading shit (or give a loading splash screen and THEN go to game)
	- maybe don't automatically go to a match if we have one -- might be the user has multiple
	- show logout button to GPG
	- hide "Join as Spaghetti" button
	- shouldn't need to de-select a character to select a new one
	- make characters move on game loop
	- fix map background
	- better hand/card UI 
	- zoom is too quick, needs to be slower
	- pan is to SLOW, or needs a bounce to it
	- fix autorotate landscape
	- Awkward Distraction is awkwardly written
	- save the game after each time a character goes, rather than after each player turn (one side with extra characters, game isn't saved between character turns)
	- hide "No more moves from opponent" status panel when ending turn
	- center text on buttons again
	- character names
	- allow players to look at their shit when it's not their turn

Tech
	- decent chance that GameHelper/BaseGameActivity aren't doing the right things anymore -- seems to be a mash-up of older sign-in code and newer
	- lots of events being passed through MainGame to MainActivity -- wonder if there is a better architecture that still keeps the Android pieces separate
	- warnings in Monogame Pipeline
	- how to do polygon objects in maps
	- Nexus 7 shows black box instead of highlighted character
	- why outside_0.xnb and outside.xnb?
	- Entities list vs Character list, why storing the same thing twice?
	- May need a different classes for Characters
		- on-device storage
		- pass between games
		- on-device in-game
	- set description, played time and progress value for SnapshotChangeMetadata

Game Design
	- evaluate whether single character or whole side is a better turn
	- make character facing directions (like for Slipped Backstab)
		- there's no "behind" for this to do anything with
		- make Slipped Backstab only if behind the character
		- have characters face the direction they last moved towards
	- make movement depend on agilty score
		- make runcondition an agility buff?

Monogame Pipeline errors:
	Had to copy Monogame.Extended.dll, MonoGame.Extended.Tiled.dll and Newtonsoft.Json.dll (netstandard2.0) into MonoGame.Extended.Content.Pipeline.3.7.0/lib/netstandard2.0 NuGet to get Pipeline to find importer
	
Map Creation:
	- remember that each layer has to be -32 vertical offset * layer number to account for 64x64 tiles in a 64x32 tile layer
		- ie, the first layer is -32, next is -64
	- "NoAvailableMovement:{layerNumber}", where layerNumber is the abs(vertical offset / 32)
	- "Deployment" must have objects "Spaghetti" and "Unicorn"

To Play:
	Tell me your Gmail account e-mail (I have to add your name to my list of testers)
	Set your Android device to Developer Mode

	Download my APK 
		https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n9SkH2JXqxD1sGsrNK80gpIvFkAw5LUg/view?usp=sharing
	Install it and open it.
	(it will get you to download and install Google Play Games)
	press "Create Match", and create a match with "rythos42" (me)
	Maybe you try it against someone else you know and like? :)
