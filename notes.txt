- consider giving Shane my old phone...I could really use his "fuck the game" mindset.
- sort out Google Play API V3, deprecated December 1st
	https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2019/03/changes-to-google-play-developer-api.html
	
MVP fixes:
	- make team class count equal
	- rematch via Join Game crashes
	- Audit:
		- character move
		- character card play
	        - name of character playing
			- effect of card 
			- target of card
		- needs to be scrollable
	- "100% Int damage" unclear -- thought it was "damage to your Int"
	- Need to show conditions on players
	- Don't make player do math (100% Int should be "1 damage (100% of Int)")

				else
			{
				gameLogPanel.Draw(spriteBatch, 40, 110);
				gameLogPanel.Components.Clear();
				data.GameLog.ForEach(gameLogEntry => gameLogPanel.Components.Add(new Text { Value = gameLogEntry.TextDescription, Font = content.Font }));
			}

Building a basic class hierarchy
	- Need more categories for some of the "higher level" things
	- some of the brainstormed cards could be entire expansion blocks worth of ideas, separate them out.

Manage Team
	- implement character levels
	- edit character decks
	- delete team
	- change character class
	- view character category levels
	- show categories of cards
	- need many more cards

Todo:
	- need some amount of randomness
		- not "to hit", I hate that
		- armour is possible
		- damage maybe, but want it to fit inside existing framework as much as possible
	- game needs an Armour stat
	- undo button
	- exception if you press "Test" before team loaded from google drive
	- some weird exception after "Win Game" button pressed, then press back. Likely due to saving.


Nice to have:
	- rename test mode to hot seat
	- notification when card can't be played, and why
	- allow characters to stand on slopes
		- draw grid on slopes
	- TauntCondition needs a message for success/fail
	- stuff at range 0 played on self without needing to tap again
	- don't allow friendly fire
	- fix card sizing on tablet
		- rejig HandOfCards spacing to shrink the cards if they don't fit!
	- hide start screen buttons if loading shit (or give a loading splash screen and THEN go to game)
	- maybe don't automatically go to a match if we have one -- might be the user has multiple
	- show logout button to GPG
	- hide "Join as Spaghetti" button
	- shouldn't need to de-select a character to select a new one
	- make characters move on game loop
	- fix map background
	- better hand/card UI 
	- zoom is too quick, needs to be slower
	- pan is to SLOW, or needs a bounce to it
	- fix autorotate landscape
	- Awkward Distraction is awkwardly written
	- save the game after each time a character goes, rather than after each player turn (one side with extra characters, game isn't saved between character turns)
	- hide "No more moves from opponent" status panel when ending turn
	- center text on buttons again
	- character names
	- allow players to look at their shit when it's not their turn

Tech
	- decent chance that GameHelper/BaseGameActivity aren't doing the right things anymore -- seems to be a mash-up of older sign-in code and newer
	- lots of events being passed through MainGame to MainActivity -- wonder if there is a better architecture that still keeps the Android pieces separate
	- warnings in Monogame Pipeline
	- how to do polygon objects in maps
	- Nexus 7 shows black box instead of highlighted character
	- why outside_0.xnb and outside.xnb?
	- Entities list vs Character list, why storing the same thing twice?
	- May need a different classes for Characters
		- on-device storage
		- pass between games
		- on-device in-game
	- set description, played time and progress value for SnapshotChangeMetadata
	- consider loosening proguard.cfg -- it's keeping all of com.google.android.gms, but last error only needed com.google.android.gms.auth.api.signin.internal.SignInHubActivity
		- check \obj\Release\90\proguard\proguard_project_references.cfg for ideas of how it works
	- send card IDs instead of the whole card around
	        
Game Design
	- Remove Lame Distraction and replace with something else, it sucks
	- evaluate whether single character or whole side is a better turn
	- make character facing directions (like for Slipped Backstab)
		- there's no "behind" for this to do anything with
		- make Slipped Backstab only if behind the character
		- have characters face the direction they last moved towards
	- make movement depend on agilty score
		- make runcondition an agility buff?


Deploying:
	1. Test that `release` build runs. Proguard/etc can mess some things up.

Monogame Pipeline errors:
	Had to copy Monogame.Extended.dll, MonoGame.Extended.Tiled.dll and Newtonsoft.Json.dll (netstandard2.0) into MonoGame.Extended.Content.Pipeline.3.7.0/lib/netstandard2.0 NuGet to get Pipeline to find importer
	
Map Creation:
	- remember that each layer has to be -32 vertical offset * layer number to account for 64x64 tiles in a 64x32 tile layer
		- ie, the first layer is -32, next is -64
	- "NoAvailableMovement:{layerNumber}", where layerNumber is the abs(vertical offset / 32)
	- "Deployment" must have objects "Spaghetti" and "Unicorn"

To Play:
	Tell me your Gmail account e-mail (I have to add your name to my list of testers)
	Set your Android device to Developer Mode
		https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options
	Download my APK 
		https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n9SkH2JXqxD1sGsrNK80gpIvFkAw5LUg/view?usp=sharing
	Install it and open it.
	(it will get you to download and install Google Play Games)
	press "Create Match", and create a match with "rythos42" (me)
	Maybe you try it against someone else you know and like? :)
