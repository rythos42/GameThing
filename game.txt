	Stamina
		The sooner you go between your last turn, the less damage you're able to do and less percent chance of success.
			- Stamina starts real strong, so careful with giving out +100% bonus to it, more like +10% bonus 
		Subtract 1/Stamina from 2, and multiply by the baseline 50% to get baseline damage modifier
			2 - 1/1 = 1					50% * 1	= 50%
			2 - 1/1.1 = 1.09		50% * 1.09 = 54.54%
			2 - 1/2 = 1.5			50% * 1.5 = 75%
			2 - 1/3 = 1.6666		50% * 1.666 = 83.333
			2 - 1/4 = 1.75			50% * 1.75	= 87.6
		Take that difference (100% - 50% = 50%), (100% - 87.6% = 12.4%) = x, is how much damage reduction a character gets if they went last and then first.
		Each character that goes, adds x * (1/characterCount) so that at the last character, that character gets 100% damage.
							
	Evade stat: small percent chance to entirely dodge attack
		2.5 * Evade^2 = MissPercent
		Evade: 
			1 gives 2.5% chance attack misses entirely.
			2 gives 12%
			3 gives 27%
			4 gives 40%

	Defense stat: static percent damage reduction
		Defense 1: 0% damage reduced
		Defense 2: 10% damage reduced
		Defense 6: 50% damage reduced
