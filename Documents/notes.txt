Todo:
	- Add all the new cards
	- Change available cards
	- Master cards
	- Class unlocks
	- draw manage team screen
	- release notes
	
Nice to have:
	- consider whether hotseat can merge battle data or not
	- show name on character panel in battle
	- "Remove" effect not currently able to be used on anything other than health
	- update Poison icon
	- inconsistency in calling things "round" vs "turn" between cards and code
	- show it better when a character has activated, when you have them selected
	- make characters "walk" towards their destination instead of instant jump
	- refresh matches list from time to time, or add a refresh button
	- inconsistent in showing status of card play
	- add Evaded to game log entry
	- refresh My Matches in case someone joined (or have a notification in that case or something)
	- ability to have multiple teams
	- lock down Firebase database, it's wide open right now
	- translatable
	- check on tablet
	- ability to name match
	- show a thing if game ends while it isn't your turn
	- make "your turn" marker more obvious
	- surrender button
	- give notification an actual icon
	- notification about battles other than the last one you joined/opened
	- title above matches buttons "Available Matches" vs "Your Matches"
	- some matches filtering/sorting when beyond 6 matches
	- highlight "End Turn" button when no moves left
	- notification when card can't be played, and why
	- allow characters to stand on slopes
		- draw grid on slopes
	- don't allow friendly fire
	- fix card sizing on tablet
		- rejig HandOfCards spacing to shrink the cards if they don't fit!
	- shouldn't need to de-select a character to select a new one
	- make characters move on game loop
	- fix map background
	- better hand/card UI 
	- zoom is too quick, needs to be slower
	- pan is to SLOW, or needs a bounce to it
	- fix autorotate landscape
	- save the game after each time a character goes, rather than after each player turn (one side with extra characters, game isn't saved between character turns)
	- hide "No more moves from opponent" status panel when ending turn
	- center text on buttons again
	- scroll through game log entries?
	- update start screen buttons to suck less
		- more information about your opponent
		- don't show all of them if you don't need to
		- able to scroll and/or filter

Tech
	- will need to fix database schema so that I can prevent users from reading each others data
	- made it so that ComponentList.Add(item) LoadsContent if possible, so much of the UI component creation (dynamic stuff) could be re-done
	Requirements:
		- is "range" on cards a type of requirement?
		- is "taunted" a type of requirement?
	- probably BattleData.LastPlayingPlayerId is redundant
	- determine difference between Contract and Entity and how should this be organized.
	- how to do polygon objects in maps
	- Nexus 7 shows black box instead of highlighted character
	- why outside_0.xnb and outside.xnb?
	- Entities list vs Character list, why storing the same thing twice?
	- set description, played time and progress value for SnapshotChangeMetadata
	- consider loosening proguard.cfg -- it's keeping all of com.google.android.gms, but not using GPG anymore
		- check \obj\Release\90\proguard\proguard_project_references.cfg for ideas of how it works
	- make ScreenComponent draw the UIComponents it contains
	- somewhere to send error logs to
	        
Game Design
	- evaluate whether single character or whole side is a better turn
	- make movement depend on agilty score
		- make runcondition an agility buff?

Moddable Abilities
	- make documentation on templatable objects
	- ensure templatable objects are minimum useful set


UI
	Toast.MakeText(Application.Context, $"Your friend has been invited to play!", ToastLength.Long).Show();

Deploying:
	1. Test that `release` build runs. Proguard/etc can mess some things up.

Monogame Pipeline errors:
	Had to copy Monogame.Extended.dll, MonoGame.Extended.Tiled.dll and Newtonsoft.Json.dll (netstandard2.0) into MonoGame.Extended.Content.Pipeline.3.7.0/lib/netstandard2.0 NuGet to get Pipeline to find importer
	
Map Creation:
	- remember that each layer has to be -32 vertical offset * layer number to account for 64x64 tiles in a 64x32 tile layer
		- ie, the first layer is -32, next is -64
	- "NoAvailableMovement:{layerNumber}", where layerNumber is the abs(vertical offset / 32)
	- "Deployment" must have objects "Spaghetti" and "Unicorn"
